chi-elections
=============

chi-elections is a Python package for loading and parsing election results from the [Chicago Board of Elections](http://www.chicagoelections.com/).

Summary Results
---------------

The Board of Elections provides election-night results at a racewide level.  The file lives at 

http://www.chicagoelections.com/results/ap/summary.txt

before election day, for testing.

It lives at

http://www.chicagoelections.com/ap/summary.txt

on election night.

### Text layout

From http://www.chicagoelections.com/results/ap/text_layout.txt:

Summary Export File Format      Length  Column Position

Candidate Number                3       5-7
Num. Eligible Precincts         4       8-11
Votes                           7       12-18
Num. Completed precincts        4       19-22
Party Abbreviation              3       23-25

Contest name                    56      33-88

Vote For                        3       152-154

### Gotchas 

Prior to election night, the test file will include all fields.  At some point on election night, the file will only contain the numeric values in the first 22 columns.

This means that you need to:

* Make sure you save candidate names in some way, like a database, before election night
* Make sure you store ballot order (Candidate Number in the text layout above) with the candidate.  You'll need to use this, in combination with Contest Code, to look up the cached candidates.  

At some point at the end of election night, the results file will no longer be available at http://www.chicagoelections.com/ap/summary.txt and will be available at http://www.chicagoelections.com/results/ap/summary.txt
.  However, it will not be updated. You'll need to scrape, enter or load results in some other way if you need updates after election night.
  

### Results client

To access the results:

    from chi_elections import SummaryClient
    
    client = SummaryClient()
    client.fetch()
    mayor = next(r for r in client.races if r.name == "Mayor")
    self.assertEqual(len(mayor.candidates), 5)

    rahm = next(c for c in mayor.candidates
                if c.full_name == "RAHM EMANUEL")
    print(rahm.vote_total)

If you want to specify an alternate url, for example the test URL, pass it to the constructor of `SummaryClient`:

    client = SummaryClient(url='http://www.chicagoelections.com/results/ap/summary.txt')
